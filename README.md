# Particle Express Seed

This is a simple express server seed with multiple environment configuration files and yeoman/grunt integration. The main purpose of this is to serve as a server seed for other projects. Grunt tasks handle code validation and reloading on file changes. I built this to be used as a git sub-module in my other applications, not as a standalone app. If you are looking for a standalone express seed app check out [node-express-mongoose-demo](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo).

## GIT Branches

Each of my other applications that make siginificant changes to this will exist as branches that will not be merged back with master. Only shared code, that can be used across all the applications will be merged back to the master.

- Secure Single Page App API (coming soon)
- Poet (coming soon)
